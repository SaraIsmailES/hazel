Concavity and curve sketching:
Absolutely! Here’s a list of important behaviors and features of functions that can be observed directly from their graphs, 
without relying on derivatives:

### 1. **Local and Absolute Extrema**
   - **Local Maximum**: A peak point where the function value is higher than its immediate neighbors.
   - **Local Minimum**: A trough point where the function value is lower than its immediate neighbors.
   - **Absolute Maximum**: The highest point over the entire domain.
   - **Absolute Minimum**: The lowest point over the entire domain.

### 2. **Asymptotes**
   - **Vertical Asymptotes**: Lines that the function approaches but never reaches, often indicating points where the function goes to infinity.
   - **Horizontal Asymptotes**: Lines that represent the end behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity or negative infinity.

### 3. **Continuity**
   - **Continuous Functions**: No breaks, jumps, or holes in the graph.
   - **Points of Discontinuity**: Where the function is not continuous, which can include:
     - **Jump Discontinuities**: Sudden jumps in function value.
     - **Infinite Discontinuities**: Approaching infinity at a certain point (often vertical asymptotes).
     - **Removable Discontinuities**: Holes in the graph where a limit exists but the function is not defined at that point.

### 4. **Endpoints**
   - Behavior at the ends of the domain, especially important for closed intervals.

### 5. **Intervals of Increase and Decrease**
   - While this usually requires derivatives, it can also be observed by noting sections where the graph consistently rises or falls.

### 6. **Concavity**
   - **Concave Up**: The graph opens upward, resembling a cup; the slope of the function is increasing.
   - **Concave Down**: The graph opens downward; the slope of the function is decreasing.

### 7. **Symmetry**
   - **Even Functions**: Symmetric about the y-axis (e.g., \( f(-x) = f(x) \)).
   - **Odd Functions**: Symmetric about the origin (e.g., \( f(-x) = -f(x) \)).

### 8. **Intercepts**
   - **X-intercepts**: Points where the graph crosses the x-axis (where \( f(x) = 0 \)).
   - **Y-intercept**: Point where the graph crosses the y-axis (value of \( f(0) \)).

### 9. **Oscillatory Behavior**
   - Rapidly alternating behavior, which may appear in certain functions
    (e.g., sine and cosine functions).

### 10. **Flat Regions**
   - Areas where the graph levels off, indicating constant values or very small changes 
   over an interval.

### 11. **Global Behavior**
   - General trends of the graph, such as overall increase/decrease or periodicity.

### 12. **Piecewise Behavior**
   - Functions defined by different expressions in different intervals, 
   which may lead to jumps or different slopes.

These observable features provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the behavior of functions and can 
help in sketching their graphs even without calculus.

In calculus, analyzing a function \( f(x) \) along with its first derivative \( f'(x) \) and second derivative \( f''(x) \) is essential for curve sketching. Here’s a breakdown of the important points and behaviors to consider:

### 1. **Finding Critical Points**
   - **Where \( f'(x) = 0 \)**: These points indicate potential local maxima, minima, 
   or points of inflection.
   - **Where \( f'(x) \) is undefined**: These may also be critical points.

### 2. **Increasing and Decreasing Intervals**
   - **If \( f'(x) > 0 \)**: The function is increasing on that interval.
   - **If \( f'(x) < 0 \)**: The function is decreasing on that interval.

### 3. **Identifying Local Extrema**
   - Use the **First Derivative Test**:
     - If \( f'(x) \) changes from positive to negative at a critical point, \( f(x) \) has a local maximum.
     - If \( f'(x) \) changes from negative to positive, \( f(x) \) has a local minimum.
     - If \( f'(x) \) does not change signs, the critical point is neither a maximum nor a minimum.

### 4. **Concavity and Points of Inflection**
   - **Where \( f''(x) = 0 \)** or is undefined: These are potential points of inflection.
   - **If \( f''(x) > 0 \)**: The function is concave up on that interval.
   - **If \( f''(x) < 0 \)**: The function is concave down on that interval.
   - Use the **Second Derivative Test** for local extrema:
     - If \( f''(c) > 0 \) at a critical point \( c \), \( f(c) \) is a local minimum.
     - If \( f''(c) < 0 \), \( f(c) \) is a local maximum.
     - If \( f''(c) = 0\), the test is inconclusive.

### 5. **End Behavior**
   - Analyze the limits as \( x \to \pm\infty \):
     - Determine \( \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) \) to understand how the function behaves at the ends.

### 6. **Intercepts**
   - **Y-intercept**: Found by evaluating \( f(0) \).
   - **X-intercepts**: Found by solving \( f(x) = 0 \).

### 7. **Asymptotic Behavior**
   - Look for vertical asymptotes where \( f(x) \) approaches infinity or negative infinity.
   - Horizontal asymptotes can be found by analyzing \( \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) \).

### 8. **Behavior at Critical Points**
   - Check the function’s value at critical points and endpoints (if they exist).

### Summary of Steps for Curve Sketching
1. Find \( f'(x) \) and \( f''(x) \).
2. Determine critical points and where \( f' \) and \( f'' \) change signs.
3. Analyze intervals for increasing/decreasing and concavity.
4. Identify local maxima/minima and points of inflection.
5. Determine intercepts and end behavior.
6. Sketch the curve, incorporating all identified features.

This structured approach will help you effectively sketch the graph of a function while understanding its behavior!

Here’s a concise list of what to prepare from \( f \), \( f' \), and \( f'' \) for sketching a graph, along with their purposes:

### From \( f(x) \) (the function):
- **Key Points**: Evaluate at specific values (e.g., critical points, intercepts).
- **Intercepts**: Find x-intercepts and y-intercepts.
- **End Behavior**: Determine behavior as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \).
- **Discontinuities**: Identify holes, jumps, and vertical asymptotes.

### From \( f'(x) \) (the first derivative):
- **Critical Points**: Find where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or is undefined (potential max/min).
- **Increasing/Decreasing Intervals**: Determine where \( f'(x) > 0 \) (increasing) and \( f'(x) < 0 \) (decreasing).
- **Local Extrema**: Use changes in sign of \( f' \) around critical points to identify local maxima and minima.

### From \( f''(x) \) (the second derivative):
- **Concavity**: Determine intervals where \( f''(x) > 0 \) (concave up) and \( f''(x) < 0 \) (concave down).
- **Points of Inflection**: Identify where \( f''(x) = 0 \) or is undefined (potential inflection points).
- **Nature of Extrema**: Use \( f''(x) \) to confirm local maxima (if \( f'' < 0 \)) or minima (if \( f'' > 0 \)).

### Purpose:
- **\( f(x) \)**: Overall shape and key points.
- **\( f' \)**: Behavior and location of extrema.
- **\( f'' \)**: Concavity and confirmation of extrema.
